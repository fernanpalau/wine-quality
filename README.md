# wine-quality

The aim of this study is to determine which factors influence the quality of a wine. For this we will use the winequality-red.csv database.

The parameters that express the quality of a wine are defined as follows:

#Alcoholic content:
They usually have between 12 and 16ยบ of Alcohol, and it is common that this determines the type of wines they like (more or less alcoholic). During the ripening of the grapes, which is increased in areas where there are more hours of sunshine, the acids are transformed into sugars. Later, during fermentation, the sugars are converted into alcohol.

#Volatile acidity:
This is mainly acetic acid (g acetic acid/100 mL), which should be as low as possible and remain stable to help preserve the wine. If the acidity increases during tasting, we can perceive it as vinegary in the nose and mouth.

#Fixed acidity:
This is the set of natural acids in the wine (tartaric, malic, citric, succinic and lactic). The most important of these is tartaric acid, which is why fixed acidity is measured in grams of tartaric acid per litre. 
Thanks to the acids that make up the fixed acidity, the natural qualities of the wine are preserved, as well as the colour.

#Citric Acid: (E-330) 
 Citric acid is the third most important acid of natural origin. Citric acid is present in wines and grapes in concentrations between 0.1-1 g/l. D. It gives the wine freshness, pleasant, fruity and aromatic sensations.
 It is an acidifier to correct acidity in musts and wines, and also has a stabilising action as an antioxidant.

#Chlorides

#Density:
Serves mainly to determine the end of fermentation.

#Chlorides:
The mineral salts in wine obviously give the wine its characteristic salty taste. It is measured in mg/L

#pH:
It is important in its perception of quality as it is expressed as a balance in the mouth between acidity and astringency. Although Ph depends on many factors (soil type, grape variety, grape ripening, among others), a well-balanced Ph will make round and unctuous wines, and is a quality parameter that is always sought after.

#Sulphates:
The vine absorbs sulphates (salts) through the roots, which reach the grapes. Once in the must, the yeasts, when fermenting, remove all the oxygen from the medium and reduce the compounds, turning the sulphates into sulphites; from these they make sulphur, and from sulphur, hydrogen sulphide. Once the vinification process is finished, and the wine has gone through its rest, the hydrogen sulphide oxidises and sulphur particles appear, which turn into sulphur. Thus, wine can naturally contain between 10 and 20 mg of sulphur per litre.



#Total sulphur dioxide:
Sulphurous anhydride is a compound of sulphur and oxygen, which, when added to the must or wine in the appropriate and permitted doses, fulfils antioxidant, antiseptic and disinfectant tasks. It is the wine protector par excellence.
Total sulphur is composed of free sulphur (which exerts antiseptic and antimicrobial action) and combined sulphur.
#Free sulphur:
On the other hand, its use in an excessive or incorrect form, can produce defective odours and flavours, and a "stinging" in the nose. On the other hand, the volatile acidity, and therefore the danger of vinegariness, rises when the "free" sulphur content falls below 10 mg/l, and it is very important to keep an eye on this value.
At a pH equal to 4.0, the concentration of molecular SO2 (free) is ten times lower than at a pH equal to 3.0, and so is its action.
